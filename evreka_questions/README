There are two django apps for questions q1 and q2.

The related functions and models can be found in 
/evreka_questions/evreka/q1/views.py
/evreka_questions/evreka/q1/models.py
/evreka_questions/evreka/q2/views.py
/evreka_questions/evreka/q2/models.py 
respectively.

q1_fill() and q2_fill() functions in the views.py are to setup database with the dummy input files I wrote, which are input_q1.txt and input_q2.txt. 
The database has already been constructed with these dummy inputs.   

q1_retrieve() and q2_retrieve() are the main functions which are answers to the questions.


The functions can be tested with :

"python3 manage.py shell"
"from q1.views import * "
"from q2.views import * "
"q1_retrieve()"
"q2_retrieve()"
